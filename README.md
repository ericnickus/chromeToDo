google chrome extension javascript to do list 

to make a google chrome extension you just make a directory, then go to google extensions (chrome browser) and 
go to manage extensions
press load unpacked   select the folder the code is in.    
That's it, just select it like a regular extension.   Look for the sick 'S' logo (he he)
